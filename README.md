This repository provides useful tutorials for the CARLA simulator

## Assignment #1
Add LIDAR and RADAR, and collision sensors to the vehicle and store the outputs in the local system.
Please only sent your codes via GitHub (Do not email me the updated codes). To do so, please first clone the repository

Submit a pull request to the repository and make any changes you want in your own branch.
Commit your changes and make sure to push them as well.

The due date will be April 5, 2025.


## Assignment #2 (Automotive Students Only)

Task #1: Integrate what you have learned in session 1 and 2 by adding RGB camera, IMU, and LIDAR sensor

to the vehicle and control it to follow the path by taking advantage of PID controller.

Store the sensor's data on your system.


Task #2: Tune the PID gains for both longitudinal and lateral control of the vehicle.

What are the important criteria for appropriate tuning of control parameters? What is the effect of each individual gain?
What approaches did you utilise to tune the gains and what goals did you set for the tuning process?
Compare the performance of the path-tracking controller in various pid gains (for lateral control) and plot the control action,
cross track error, vehicle location, vehicle speed, and desired trajectory. According to your comparison and results, what final gains you would suggest for the controller?


Task #3: Create a looped trajectory for the vehicle and ensure that your autonomous car is capable of following this loop infinitely.
Email me your results as well as your report in the specified format with the following title:
